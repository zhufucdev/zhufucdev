# Greetings from an Idiot Coder

## Hi there! 👏

👨‍🎓 I'm zhufucdev, a NUIST student majoring in Digital Information.

I write dumb programs mainly out of temporal passion.

Btw, I make videos in Mandarin mixed with poor English.

## Persona

A fake personality of mine can be revealed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuopPG2iD3Xt89vK2lhtfwQ) 
and [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/195228232), who speaks quite a lot nonsense 
and makes dumb joke about technology.

Wondering who would love such a YouTuber.

## What I use GitHub for

~~I make friends on it~~
