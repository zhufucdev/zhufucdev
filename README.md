# Greetings from a pro

## Hi there! 👏

I'm Steve Reed, a pro student😎, currently learning computer science.

I do not like tofu.

## Persona 👺

You may find me interesting, and you are 100% correct.
I know many things, and judge even more things sharply (sometimes harshly),
but that doesn't mean I am a mean person. I am very kind to people.

I am a chill person. I am pretty introvert so you can't expect too much about
making friend with me. Me being kind to people doesn't mean I love everyone.

## Get contacted 📩

If you are interested in computer science, humanities, economy, design, music,
or anything you get, you can talk to me, but come up with a clear topic so that
I don't waste my time. My contact info is on the github profile.

### Commerical coop

I write good program. I mainly do Android🤖, web, and desktop sometimes.
If you want me to write programs for you, pay me decent and we can talk.
